## ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è What is Steam-Custom-Artworks?
Steam-Custom-Artworks is a collection of custom game artworks made to replace the default ones in your Steam library - but with a twist: everything is designed in the same style.
Unlike sites like SteamGridDB, where every image looks totally different depending on the artist, this project focuses on consistency so your library actually looks clean and unified.

No more mismatched covers or random styles - just clean, polished, matching art across your whole collection.

## üì•Ô∏è Install
1. Download `grid.zip` from the [Releases](https://github.com/SpaceTheme/Steam-Custom-Artworks/releases) section.
1. Navigate to your Steam root directory, then go to: `steam/userdata/<your-account-id>/config/` | [Get your accountID here](https://noxy.netlify.app/tools/fetchsteam) ( you will have one folder if you have only 1 account in steam )
1. Create a folder named `grid` if it doesn't already exist.
1. Move the downloaded `grid.zip` file into the `grid` folder and extract it there.<br>
Important: If the extracted files are inside another `grid` folder (i.e., `grid/grid/`), move all contents from the second `grid` folder into the first one.
1. Delete the `grid.zip` file.
1. Restart Steam.
